# Sudoku-Project 🍄⚡
This is my first project after my first semester in Computer Engineering at Shahid Beheshti University.  
The game includes **one pre-prepared Sudoku puzzle** that you can solve as many times as you like.  
But be warned—**it's not an easy Sudoku to solve!** 👀  

## Game Introduction 🎮
Sudoku is a number puzzle where you must follow specific rules to fill in the grid correctly.  
The most common type of Sudoku consists of a **9×9 grid**, which is further divided into **nine 3×3 subgrids**.  

Some numbers are already placed in the grid, and you must fill in the rest while following these rules:  
🟣Each **row and column** must contain the numbers **1 to 9** without repetition.  
🟣Each **3×3 subgrid** must also contain the numbers **1 to 9** without repetition.
